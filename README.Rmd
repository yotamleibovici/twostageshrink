# twostageshrink

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This package is intended to provide the data used to produce the figures in
my MSc thesis, and generic functions which can be used to generate similar
figures, produced with possibly different parameters.

## Installation
<!--
You can install the released version of twostageshrink from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("twostageshrink")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("yotamleibovici/twostageshrink")
```
-->
## Example

In order to reproduce the figures of the different two-stage methods'
characteristics appearing in the thesis (their FWER and their number of true
rejections), the following code should be used:

```{r example}
library(twostageshrink)

# Prints the plot comparing the true rejections number of
# the different methods, under the 1st configuration:
reproduce(1, "trej")

# Prints the plot comparing the FWER of
# the different methods, under the 2nd configuration:
reproduce(2, "fwer")

# Prints the plot of the different MSE-ratio for
# different cases, under the 1st configuration:
shrink_reproduce(1)
```

The above lines demonstrate the main usage of this package.
The `reproduce()` function uses the data in the `data/` directory,
which is generated with scripts that can be found in the `data-raw/`
directory. However, if you wish to produce variants of these figures with changes in
parameters, you can use it similarly to the scripts. The function that might
help you are `simulate()`, `perform()`, `evaluate()` and
`measure()`, in this order. For the shrinkage figures, the relevant
functions to generate data and manipulate it similarly to the shown in the
thesis are `shrink_simulate()`, `shrink_estimate()`,
`shrink_evaluate()` and `shrink_reproduce()`, in this order.

Usage example for user-defined parameters for the two-stage figures:

```{r}
simulate(
    nobs = seq(from = 10, to = 50, by = 10),
    nexper = 30,
    nhyp = 30,
    config = tibble::tribble(
        ~altr, ~gaddend, ~gfactor, ~gexp, ~baddend, ~bfactor, ~bexp, ~prop,
        FALSE, 0, 0,   0, 0, 0,   0, 0.5,
        FALSE, 0, 3, 3/4, 0, 0,   0, 0.0,
        FALSE, 0, 3, 1/2, 0, 0,   0, 0.4,
        FALSE, 0, 3, 1/3, 0, 0,   0, 0.0,
        FALSE, 1, 3, 1/2, 0, 0,   0, 0.0,
        TRUE,  0, 3, 1/2, 0, 3, 1/2, 0.1,
        TRUE,  0, 3, 1/3, 0, 3, 1/2, 0.0,
        TRUE,  1, 3, 1/2, 0, 3, 1/2, 0.0
    )
) %>%
  
    perform(
        filt_test = pmin(gpval, bpval) < 0.001,
        base_pval = pmax(gpval, bpval),
        base_thrl = 0.1,
        base_thrl_adj_method = function(thrl) { thrl / sum(!is.na(thrl)) },
        nobs, exper
    ) %>%
  
    evaluate(nobs, exper) %>%
  
    measure(nobs)
```

Usage example for user-defined parameters for the MSE-ratio figures:

```{r}
  shrink_simulate(
    nobs = seq(from = 10, to = 50, by = 10),
    nrep = 30,
    config = tibble::tribble(
      ~gexp, ~gfactor, ~bexp, ~bfactor,
      0.5, 1, 0.6, 1,
      0.5, 1, 0.5, 1,
      0.5, 2, 0.5, sqrt(5/3),
      0.5, 2, 0.5, 2,
      0.4, 2, 0.4, 1
    )
  ) %>%

    shrink_estimate(
      filtexp = 0.7, filtfactor = 1,
      estim_base = gestim*bestim, estim_filt = abs(gestim*bestim)
    ) %>%

    shrink_evaluate(nobs, case)
```



<!--
What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
